# Contributing to GREASE

## Welcome
First, welcome! We are so excited to have someone
spend time helping us build up GREASE! Our goal is to 
build awesome stuff and help people live more meaningful
lives and not have to put out fires constantly. Here's a quick
checklist for Non-Target contributors though:
  * Signed Contribution Agreement

## How to Contribute to GREASE
Okay now that's out of the way, lets go over some stuff we
like to see in pull requests. We use [git-flow](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/)
to keep stuff cleaned up. Additionally we ask you please fork
the project into your own namespace to keep the GREASE namespace
as clean as possible. Here is the basic workflow:
  1. Have awesome idea (easy for you though)
  2. Fork GREASE
  3. Start a new branch for your feature
    * branch prefixes we use:
      * `feature/`: for features
      * `support/`: for general refactoring
      * `hotfix/`: something broke and we need to fix it now
  4. Submit your Pull Request! Do it early and mark it `WIP` so
  the maintainer staff can help review it!
  5. Tell the PR thread you are ready for review
  6. If any changes need to be made we will let you know
  7. Profit! You've merged into GREASE
  
## Community Guidelines
  1. Be a Decent Human
     * We love having people help-out GREASE and while we
    understand passion in a debate, we ask you remain kind
    to everyone and that code is treated as a gift, not an
    item of work for you to review. Additionally if changes
    need to be made, _please_ let us know! We want to make
    GREASE as awesome as possible!
  2. Maintainers will Maintain 
     * As a maintainer, you're expected to help the 
    community out!
     * We want to ensure contributors feel the speed at which 
     we pride ourselves in. Maintainers are expected:
       * To triage any new PR within 24 hours of submission
       * If review is requested/required: Completed in 96 hours
       of submission
       * If there are large merge conflicts (more than 5 files)
       work with the contributor if they request it to resolve
       the conflicts
  3. You are responsible for your PR
     * Filing a PR to GREASE is exciting! Make sure to take
     ownership of the process to ensure speedy processing
     * Maintainers are busy and it is our responsibility to respond.
     We do though ask you to respond quickly when we ask for changes,
     make comments or ask questions. We will respond by our time line
     from the previous point, But we will expect you to interact back
     if required
